                    Your privacy is very important to us.

                    We do our best to keep ITStudent safe, but we cannot guarantee it. We need your help to do that, which includes the following commitments:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            You will not engage in unlawful multi-level marketing, such as a pyramid scheme, on ITStudent.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You will not upload viruses or other malicious code.

                        <li>
                            You will not solicit login information or access an account belonging to someone else.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You will not bully, intimidate, or harass any user.

                    ITStudent users provide their real names and information, and we need your help to keep it that way. Here are some commitments you make to us relating to registering and maintaining the security of your account:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            You will not provide any false personal information on ITStudent, or create an account for anyone other than yourself without permission.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You will not create more than one personal profile.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If we disable your account, you will not create another one without our permission.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You will not share your password, (or in the case of developers, your secret key), let anyone else access your account, or do anything else that might jeopardize the security of your account.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You will not transfer your account (including any page or application you administer) to anyone without first getting our written permission.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If you select a username for your account we reserve the right to remove or reclaim it if we believe appropriate (such as when a trademark owner complains about a username that does not closely relate to a user's actual name).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You will not give us information that you independently collect from a user or a user's content without that user's consent.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You will make it easy for users to remove or disconnect from your application.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You will make it easy for users to contact you. We can also share your email address with users and others claiming that you have infringed or otherwise violated their rights.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You will not show third party ads or web search boxes on ITStudent.
                        </li>
